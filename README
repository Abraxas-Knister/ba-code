Disclaimer: This suite has only been tested on linux debian/ubuntu.
If it crashes on a different setup I'm not the one to blame. 

            +----------------+
            | GET IT RUNNING |
            +----------------+

Install by running make. Proper pre-todo is
 +----------------------
 | $ cat > .postitionofeigen.mk << EOF
 | > Eigen = /path/to/eigen/
 | > EOF
 | $
 +----------------------  
because I built on different sites and one didn't have eigen
installed. Read the code of main/informal.hpp to get an initial
overview on how everything is working together. The suite needs
testing material which you can provide by starting the GUI:
 +----------------------
 | navigate here, start the GUI
 |  $ ./GUI.py & <---- wrong
 |  $ ./GUI.py   <---- right
 | in the GUI:
 |  Get accommodated. You can hit one of the keys [cmp] to change the
 |  edition mode of the net. Clicking left/right mouse buttons also
 |  does cool things. There should be some Buttons on the right
 |  that offer some geometries I already made and darth vader.
 |  
 |  Once you are finished save the thing via the menue, you will be
 |  prompted with a menue in the shell that guides you through the
 |  harsh travel of name-choosing. Currently not installed:
 |  removing of nets other than by hand (which is done by editing
 |  adj/nets textfile).
 | 
 | in the shell:
 |  $ ./daq.py
 | this creates .projects/ which is readable by the cpp programs
 +----------------------
After make did it's job the executables are in main named *.prog. 
I did sth like 
 +----------------------
 | $ cat > ex << EOF
 | > #!/bin/sh
 | > ./main/a.prog 
 | > ./main/b.prog
 | $ chmod 770 ex
 | $ nohup > LOG 2> ERRLOG ./ex &
 +----------------------
which is a good thing when you have made a list of really
CPU-time thirsty programs to let them run in the background
while you do sth else.

            +-------------------+
            | CODEBASE OVERVIEW |
            +-------------------+

cfet.cpp, disturbe.cpp, evolve.cpp, fut-past.cpp, lanczos.cpp
:timeev.hpp: defines evolving and disturbing
   -> cfets are not important here.
   -> lanczos does the main job.
   -> evolve is the function that has been used at most

setup.cpp
:setup.hpp: struct that bears information

ham.cpp      
:ham.hpp: how the hamiltonian is sculptured from the adjacency matrix
  
sparse.cpp
:sparse.hpp: CRS format (where numeric load is born)

density.cpp
:density.hpp: just ignore
